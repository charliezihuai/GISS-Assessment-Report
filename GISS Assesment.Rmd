```

#Data Use
#In this project, two maps were made to show the Fortune global 500 (companies) by numbers and countries in 2018. The data was collected directly from the official site of Fortune. However, there was not existed data of the Fortune 500 listed by the number of every country. Instead, the ranking data from 1 to 500 was provided. The data was reformatted manually into the data of numbers and companies that in global 500 for every country. Further, the unique FIPS code was added to every country to help connect the data to the map.

#Map Style
#In the both maps, we chose to use different colors to help viewers to distinguish the different level of Fortune global 500 companies in every country. Next, we added the content of classes at the left bottom corner to help viewer to understand the range of amount of each color. In map made by ArcMap, the content and title of map was in the map. However, we separated them from the map in R Studio. The style we used in ArcMap used every inch of free area in the map to provide viewers more information. The style we used in R Studio would help viewers to read the content and the title more clearly and easily.

#Data Break
#For the classification of the ArcMap, the Nature Breaks by Jenks selected as the classification way. There were 9 classes in total. At first, it was 0, which means there was not any Fortune global 500 companies in this country. Then it is 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 16, 17 to 21, 22 to 32, 33 to 52 and 53 to 126. The same break was used in R map. The difference was there was only 8 breaks in R map. We combined 0 and 1 to 2 into a same class.

#Color
#In the map made by ArcMap, grey color was set as the background. The white part in the map meant there was not any Fortune global 500 company in this country. At the same time, the darker red in the certain area meant the greater number of Fortune global 500 companies. At last, the title and reference were in black, which would be easy to read and would fit the overall style of the map. In map made by R, the color group 'OrRd' was used as the code showed. The way for classification was similar to map that made by ArcMap. The darker red would lead to more Fortune global 500 companies.

#Conclusion - R vs ArcMap
#ArcMap is a globally wildly used map software with easy-access UI designed. It does not require for programming knowledge or any previous mapping experience. Moreover, there is a mature community for ArcMap for users. However, it can be hard to continue to work on others' project with ArcMap. The layers and labels can be confused when users want to continue on a finished map. On the other hand, R Studio welcomes users to continue the work because the map is made by code, which would help other users to understand functions. R is high efficiency as well. The configuration of hardware is less depended than ArcMap did. However, making map with R is not as popular as ArcMap, which results in the insufficient of community supports and the delay of software updating. Moreover, R Studio does not welcome users without programming skill since it is code only map making. After all, both of R Studio and ArcMap are great tools for mapping. ArcMap is better for non-programming knowledge users, while R Studio can achieve more high-level functions.

#PART 2

#Preparation
#In part 2, the ArcMap was the software we used to solve all six questions. ArcMap had lot of well-done tools and functions to complete the work more easily and higher efficiently. The data we used was the treasure hunt winner of 2016. In this part, there were four layers we need, they were the map file ‘LondonWard’, the route file ‘Team7’, the London underground station file ‘Station’, and the treasure hunt locations file ‘HuntAddresses’. First of all, all files needed to be formed to the same coordination system. The project tool was used to finish the formation.

!['Figure 2.1 - Tool ‘Project’'](DATA/2.1.PNG)

#After we got all relevant files transferred to the same coordination system, we could check the coordination system of specific file by clicking the property of the file.

!['Figure 2.2 - Property of File ‘LondonWardsNew’'](DATA/2.2.PNG)

#Question 1
#We could get information of this shape by opening the ‘Attribute Table’ of ‘Projected Route’. In this table, we found the ‘Shape_Length’ of this shape, which was 46603.260772 meters. 

!['Figure 2.3 - Table of ‘Projected Route’'](DATA/2.3.PNG)

#Question 2
#As figure 2.4 shows, there were map with the route and stations, and there were two ways to solve this question. We could use the alternative way to verify the result.

!['Figure 2.4 – Map with Route and Stations'](DATA/2.4.PNG)

#1.	Making buffer around the station
#First of all, we made buffers for every station by using ‘Buffer’ tool.

!['Figure 2.5 – Tool ‘Buffer’'](DATA/2.5.PNG)

#We set the input as the file ‘Station’, and saved the output as ‘StationBuffer 100’. Also, we set the linear unit as ‘100’. Then, we can get a 100 meter buffer for every station. 

!['Figure 2.6 – Stations with Buffers'](DATA/2.6.PNG)

#Then, we highlighted the buffer that on the route by using ‘Select By Location’ tool. We chose ‘StationBuffer 100’ as target layer and ‘Project Route’ as source layer. Therefore, the buffer that on the route are selected. Like the figure 2.8 showed, the table told us there were 24 stations.

!['Figure 2.7 – Tool ‘Select By Location’'](DATA/2.7.PNG)
!['Figure 2.8 – Table of Selected Station Buffers'](DATA/2.8.PNG)

#2.	Making buffer around the route
#Another way was using the same method, the different was that we made buffer around route instead of stations. As the figure 2.10 showed, we got the same result, which verified our answer.

!['Figure 2.9 – Route with Buffer '](DATA/2.9.PNG)
!['Figure 2.10 – Result'](DATA/2.10.PNG)

#Question 3
#In Question 3, we used the first way in Question 2. We built 300 meters buffers for every location. Then, in the table, using ‘Statistic’ tool, we got the sum of the selected points as figure 2.12 showed, and they scored 60 points.

!['Figure 2.11 – Selected Hunt Locations'](DATA/2.11.PNG)
!['Figure 2.12 – Sum of Selected Point'](DATA/2.12.PNG)

#Question 4
#We used same selecting method to highlight the borough that the route crossed. We outputted the select area as ‘Q4SELECTED’. In attribute table, we could easily find out the City of London had highest rates of Male Life Expectancy while Weavers had lowest. 

!['Figure 2.13 – Selected Boroughs'](DATA/2.13.PNG)
!['Figure 2.14 – Highest Rates of Male Life Expectancy'](DATA/2.14.PNG)
!['Figure 2.15 – Lowest Rates of Male Life Expectancy'](DATA/2.15.PNG)

#Question 5
#By using same tool ‘statistics’, we could easily found that the mean for male was 77.98 and 83.56 for female.  

!['Figure 2.16 – Average life expectancy for male'](DATA/2.16.PNG)
!['Figure 2.17 – Average life expectancy for female'](DATA/2.17.PNG)

#Question 6
#In this question, we would know if there was any special pattern for hunt location attribution. We assumed that the hunt location that further to city center scored more points. We used tool ‘Spatial Autocorrelation (Morans I)’ to test if there was any spatial correlation.  

!['Figure 2.18 – Report'](DATA/2.18.PNG)

#As the report showed, the p-value was under 0.05, which could prove there was a significant correlation, which meant there was a special pattern between scores and distances from hunt location to city center. 

#Conclusion
#In part 2, we explored serval useful tools in ArcMap to help us complete 6 questions more efficiently. It replaced most of manual works, like calculation, which saved tons of time and reduced the mistakes. Moreover, these tools could be easily understood by every user because it did not require any programming skill, which R Studio cannot provide. ArcMap is a powerful mapping software with various tools and functions. In future, we would like to explore more tools and functions in ArcMap to progress the mapping skill.

#PART 3

#Introduction
#In this mini project, we planned to make an interactive map that supported user to browse the crime report in Greater London from 1999 to 2016. There were three functions that we built. First of all, we offered user the map that divided by boroughs in London. Then, we built a year-choosing function to achieve the user’s requirement on browsing crime reports on various years. At last, a category function was built to offer users to choose the type of crimes. As we planned to build an interactive map, we used R Studio to create a Shiny App to achieve our goals. Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. (Shiny.rstudio.com, 2019) In our project, we mainly used library ShinyDashboard as a platform to build an interactive map with friendly UI for all kinds of users. Moreover, our app could be uploaded to Internet and be accessed for all users around the world anytime. 

!['Figure 3.1 – ShinyApp ‘London Crime Report’'](DATA/3.1.PNG)

#Project Proposal
#From the data provided by London datastore, the crime rate of London was higher than the average England and Wales crime rate from 2002 to 2012 as the figure 3.3 showed. Although, there was a reducing trend of crime rate. However, it was still almost one time greater than the average England and Wales crime rate. London, as a capital of the fourth biggest country, the biggest city in Europe and the second biggest city in the world, the best security shall be equipped to secure the safety of this city. However, there were serval terrible crime attacks that caused deaths and injured in last 10 years, like the London Bridge attack in 2017. Hence, we would like to create an interactive map, which based on ShinyApp, to provide crime reports data by various crime types and boroughs in London. 

!['Figure 3.2 – London VS England and Wales Crime Rate 2002 - 2012'](DATA/3.2.PNG)

#Project Design
#This project was divided into three parts, and there was serval sub-part under each part, and they were:

!['Figure 3.3 – Project Structure'](DATA/3.3.PNG)

#Data Use
#In our project, there were two kinds of data we required. First of all, it was the map data since we are providing an interactive map. We used ‘Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London’ from London Datastore. Secondly, we collected the crime report data in Greater London from 1999 to 2016 from ‘Recorded Crime: Borough Rates’ from London Datastore. This crime report data included the data of all crime reports of 32 boroughs (excluded City of London) from 1999 to 2016. Also, it offered 9 kinds of crime reports, which includes ‘Violence Against the Person’, ‘Sexual Offences’, ‘Robbery’, ‘Burglary’, ‘Theft and Handling’, ‘Fraud or Forgery’, ‘Criminal Damage’, ‘Drugs’ and ‘Other Notifiable Offences’. However, the original data was not able to be directly used in our Shiny App. Hence, we reformatted the data to the figure 3.4 shows. 

!['Figure 3.4 – Reformatted Data'](DATA/3.4.PNG)

#In reformatted data, there were five columns that we used. Column ‘Code’ and ‘NAME’ helped us to join the data to the map. Column ‘Year’ and ‘Categories’ helped us identify the data that user need by choosing the year and the category. At last, column ‘Reports’ stored the data we need and would be presented on the map if user required. 

#Code Breakdown
#In our project, there were two code files, the first one was ‘ui.R’, which provided the friendly user interface with the map and contents. First of all, we used code in figure 3.5 to identify the title of our Shiny App, which showed in figure 3.6. 

```{r}
#figure 3.5
header<-dashboardHeader(title="London Crime Report")
```

!['Figure 3.6 – Header'](DATA/3.6.PNG)

#After header, the body part was designed. There were four individual parts in body as figure 3.7 shows. The part in blue frame was designed as a message part for authorizer to leave users import message. In our project, this part notified users the reason that City of London was not in this map, and it provided users personal information of the authorizer of this app. As the code in figure 3.8, we first set the width to 12, which was the maximum. It would allow the message part could always fill the page. Then, we inputted the information that we wanted to show to users. We would set the name of authorizer as a link as well. By clicking the name, it would automatic create a new email to authorizer. 

!['Figure 3.7 – Body'](DATA/3.7.PNG)

```{r}
#figure 3.8
column(width = 12,
           box(width = NULL, solidHeader = TRUE,
               "NOTIFICATION: City of London is not in this map because of the lack of data. Sorry for the inconvenience.",
               p("Thanks for using the tool. This tool is made by ", a("Zihuai Huang", href = "mailto:ucfnuab@ucl.ac.uk"))
               ))
```

#The part in black frame was the map of this app. It was brought by code in figure 3.9. It mainly supported by the library ‘Leaflet’, and ‘londonMap’ is called from ‘server.R’, and the height of the map to 500. 

```{r}
#figure 3.9
 column(width = 9,
           box(width = NULL, solidHeader = TRUE,
               leafletOutput("londonMap", height=500)
           )
    )
```

#The part in red was the content of this app. It offered users the choosing of years and categories. In this part, we called three arguments that we built in ‘server.R’ as well, which are ‘ChosenYear’, ‘cate’ and ‘Categories’. The ‘uiOutput’ could output the style we built, and ‘radioButtons’ outputted the choosing content. Those definitions achieved the connection between every category and data. 

```{r}
#figure 3.10
column(width=3,
           box(width=NULL, 
               uiOutput("ChosenYear"),
               radioButtons("cate", "Categories",c("All recorded offences"="All recorded offences",
                                                   "Violence Against the Person"="Violence Against the Person",
                                                   "Sexual Offences" = "Sexual Offences", "Robbery"="Robbery" , 
                                                   "Burglary"="Burglary" , 
                                                   "Theft and Handling"="Theft and Handling" , 
                                                   "Fraud or Forgery"="Fraud or Forgery" , 
                                                   "Criminal Damage"="Criminal Damage" , 
                                                   "Drugs"="Drugs",
                                                   "Other Notifiable Offences"="Other Notifiable Offences"))
           )
)
```

#At last we used code in figure 3.11 to set the part that we wanted to input in our app. 

```{r}
#figure 3.11
dashboardPage(
  skin = "black",
  header,
  #disable the sidebar
  dashboardSidebar(disable = TRUE),
  body
)
```

#After the writing of ‘ui.R’, we wrote ‘server.R’ to build functions. In this file, we used four libraries. First of all, library ‘dplyr’ helped us work with data easier and faster. In out project, it helped us read and combine the data. After we inputted the data, we need to tidy the data, which we used library ‘tidyr’. Arranging your data in this way makes it easier to work with because you have a consistent way of referring to variables (as column names) and observations (as row indices). (Blog.rstudio.com, 2019) Then, we used library ‘leaflet’, which was one of the most important libraries that we used in our app since it helped us present an interactive map. At last, we used library ‘rgdal’, which stands for Geospatia' Data Abstraction Library, to help us to read the map file. 

#The body part of ‘server.R’ would be divided into two parts, which were ‘Preparation and Functions’. In the preparation part, there were four processes we did (figure 3.12). Firstly, we read the map file that we downloaded from London Datastore. Then, we transformed it to the ideal coordination. We used EPSG: 4326 in our project, which was one of the most common coordination. After we got the correct coordination, we identified our bounds in this project, which were London boroughs. At last, when we finished processing the map, we read our data from the reformatted CSV file. 

```{r}
#figure 3.12
boroughs<-readOGR(dsn="Data/ESRI") #read the map data

boroughs<-spTransform(boroughs, CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))  #transfer to the format we can work on

bounds<-bbox(boroughs)  #identify the bounds


projectdata<-read.csv("Data/report9916.csv") #get our report data
```

#After the preparation, it was the functions building part, and we divided this part into 4 smaller parts. Each part meant a function. At the beginning, it is ‘getDataSet’ function. We identified ‘dataSet’, which could support the connection between user’s input and the correct data. Then, we identified that the data in CSV would join the data in the map by the parameter ‘NAME’. (Figure 3.13) 

```{r}
#figure 3.13
getDataSet<-reactive({
    
    dataSet<-projectdata[projectdata$Year==input$dataYear & projectdata$Categories==input$cate,] #preparation to get the input
    
    joinedDataset<-boroughs #copy GIS data

    joinedDataset@data <- suppressWarnings(left_join(joinedDataset@data, dataSet, by="NAME")) #combination with 'name'
    
    joinedDataset
  })
```

#Then, we set the map style in our app. At first, we identified that we used ‘leaflet’ to present our interactive map, and it was referenced on the map (figure 3.15). After that, we used a grey layer from Basemaps. Next, we referenced the authorizer of the map and the map source. It would show the website for more information by clicking the links. (Figure 3.14)

```{r}
#figure 3.14
 output$londonMap<-renderLeaflet({
    leaflet() %>% 
      addTiles('http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', 
               attribution='Map tiles by <a href="mailto:ucfnuab@ucl.ac.uk">Zihuai Huang</a>,
               <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a> &mdash; 
               Map data &copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>') %>% 
      setView(mean(bounds[1,]), mean(bounds[2,]), zoom=9.5) #setting the default view
    
  })
```

!['Figure 3.15 – Attribution of Map'](DATA/3.15.PNG)

#In the end, we set the view of map, which was the default view when user opened the app. We set the view to our bounds, which we had identified in ‘getDataset’ function. We set the zoom to the 9.5, then the map could be presented as the figure 3.16 shows. Or the map would be presented as the figure 3.17 shows (when zoom = NULL). It was important to set the zoom to an ideal number since it would directly help user to find the bounds. (Figure 3.14)

!['Figure 3.16 – Map When ‘Zoom = 9.5’'](DATA/3.16.PNG)
!['Figure 3.17 – Figure 3.17 – Map When ‘Zoom = NULL’'](DATA/3.17.PNG)

#After we set the style of the map, we built the ‘ChosenYear’ function as the figure 3.18 showed, and the code would bring us the drag down menu to choose year like the figure 3.19 showed. We set the style of listing years as decreasing and the year range as 1.

```{r}
#figure 3.18
output$ChosenYear<-renderUI({
    yearRange<-sort(unique(as.numeric(projectdata$Year)), decreasing=TRUE)
    selectInput("dataYear", "Year", choices=yearRange, selected=yearRange[1])
  })
```

!['Figure 3.19 – Function ‘ChosenYear’'](DATA/3.19.PNG)

#At last, we built the function ‘observe’, and we would divide this part into two smaller parts. The first one, we defined how the map would present the different data, and we chose the color pattern greys to present the different value. Then, we defined the classification in our map, and we continued to define the pop-up window in our map by the code in figure 3.20, we defined that there are three kinds of data that we wanted to show to user. First of all, it would show the name of the certain borough. Then, the number of reports would be showed as well. At last, the menu to present the year that user chose. (Figure 3.21)

```{r}
#figure 3.20
observe({
    theData<-getDataSet() 
    
    pal <- colorQuantile("Greys", theData$Reports, n = 9) 
    
    dataINFO <- paste0("<strong>Borough: </strong>", 
                            theData$NAME, 
                            "<br><strong>",
                            input$cate," 
                            reports: </strong>", 
                            theData$Reports,
                            "<br><strong>",
                            "Year</strong>: ",
                            theData$Year)
```

!['Figure 3.21 – Pop-Up Menu'](DATA/3.21.PNG)

#At last, we used the code in figure 3.22 to achieve the map changing when user switched year or category. This function contained three processes, it would print the map and existed polygons at first, then polygons would be cleaned and replaced by new polygons by using the function ‘addPolygons’. In function ‘addPolygons’, we defined that the color that filled these new polygons is followed the same color style, which was ‘Greys’. Then, the index of transparency was set to 0.7. We defined the color of bounds of polygons as null and the width as 0. This map style setting would help the map became natural with the background map and the whole dashboard. Figure 3.23 is an example that when the width of bounds is setting to 5.

```{r}
#figure 3.22
leafletProxy("londonMap", data = theData) %>%
      clearShapes() %>%
      addPolygons(data = theData,
                  fillColor = pal(theData$Reports), 
                  fillOpacity = 0.7, 
                  color = NULL, 
                  weight = 0,
                  popup = dataINFO)})
```

!['Figure 3.23 – While ‘weight’ in Figure 3.21 is 5'](DATA/3.23.PNG)

#Conclusion and Further Work
#In this project, we used R studio and ShinyApp to accomplish an interactive map tool that could help the user to compare the crime reports data in London more visualized. We provided various categories of data and wide scale of years for user to do deeper researches. Moreover, our ShinyApp had uploaded to the customize domain, which supported users to access anytime. (See reference to access the tool) Also, our app could be embedded to an existed site, which extended the usage of the app. However, there are still much more works that we can continue to progress since R and ShinyApp offer more better functions. For example, we can progress some charts or plot that would help users to compare the data. In 2018, Paula Morage from Lancaster University showed us that the data uploading and map uploading functions (Moraga, 2018), which offers user more since this tool allows users to use their own data and map. Also, we could continue on our current work to update the accurate the time scale to months as the original data offered related data. R studio with ShinyApp is a strong tool to build an interactive map tool. In future, we will continue to progress our app for more functions.
